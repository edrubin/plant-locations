# readme

This repository provides the replication code and data for the paper [*Downwind and out: The strategic dispersion of power plants and their pollution*](https://edrub.in/Papers/draft-plant-locations.pdf) in the [JAERE](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jaere/current).

## organization

This repository focuses on four subdirectories:

- `CodeR` code to clean/prep the data and conduct the analyses;
- `DataRaw` pre-cleaning data;
- `DataClean` post-cleaning data used in the analysis;

You will need to create two additional directories for the output.

- `Figures` figures and tables generated by the code;
- `Tables` for a lonely table.

## data

The provided data should support the paper's findings.

## code 

The code all uses R. You should be able to run the scripts individually and sequentially (ordered alphanumerically), beginning with `000a1-clean-egrid-2018.R` and ending with `006d-map-nonattainment-examples.R`.
